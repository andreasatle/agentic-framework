Upon returning to the hive, the foraging bee regurgitates the nectar, passing it to house bees through a process called trophallaxis. These house bees further process the nectar by repeatedly ingesting and regurgitating it, mixing it with additional enzymes that continue the transformation. This enzymatic activity reduces the water content and converts the nectar into a more stable substance.
