The biology of bees encompasses the physical characteristics, behaviors, and life cycle stages that are essential to their role in honey production. Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their ability to collect nectar and pollen from flowers. Their bodies are adapted for this task, featuring specialized structures such as hairy legs and a proboscis for gathering and transporting nectar.
