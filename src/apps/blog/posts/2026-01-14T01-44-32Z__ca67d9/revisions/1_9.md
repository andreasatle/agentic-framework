The partially processed nectar is then deposited into the hexagonal wax cells of the honeycomb. To facilitate evaporation of excess water, bees fan the nectar with their wings, promoting airflow and drying the substance until it reaches the desired viscosity and sugar concentration. Once sufficiently dehydrated, the nectar solidifies into honey, which is then sealed with a wax cap to preserve it.
