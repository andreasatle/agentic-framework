The life cycle of a bee includes four main stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This complete metamorphosis allows for the development of distinct castes within the colony, including the queen, workers, and drones, each with specific roles. Worker bees, which are female, perform the majority of tasks related to foraging, hive maintenance, and honey production. The queen's primary function is reproduction, while drones are male bees whose main role is to mate with a queen.
