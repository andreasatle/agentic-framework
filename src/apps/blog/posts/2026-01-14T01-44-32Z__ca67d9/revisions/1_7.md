The honey production process is a complex and fascinating sequence of actions carried out by bees, rooted deeply in their biological functions as previously defined. It begins with the collection of nectar, a sugary liquid secreted by flowers, which bees gather using their specialized mouthparts. Once collected, the nectar is stored temporarily in the bee's crop, also known as the honey stomach, where enzymes begin to break down the complex sugars into simpler ones.
