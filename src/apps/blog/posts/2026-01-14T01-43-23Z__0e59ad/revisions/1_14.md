In addition to their pollination role, bees contribute to ecosystems through honey production. Honey serves as a food source for bees themselves and can also be utilized by other species, including humans. The production of honey reflects the health of bee populations and, by extension, the vitality of the ecosystems they inhabit. Thus, the ecological role of bees encompasses both their direct interactions with plants and their broader impact on ecosystem stability and resilience.
