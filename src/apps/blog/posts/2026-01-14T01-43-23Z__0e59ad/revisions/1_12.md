Bees play a crucial ecological role that extends far beyond their well-known ability to produce honey. Their activities significantly influence the health and sustainability of ecosystems through the process of pollination. Pollination, facilitated by bees as they collect nectar and pollen from flowers, is essential for the reproduction of many plant species. This interaction not only supports plant biodiversity but also underpins the food webs that depend on these plants.
