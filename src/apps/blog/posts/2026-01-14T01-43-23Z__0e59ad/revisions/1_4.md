The life cycle of bees is a complex process that begins with the egg stage, followed by the larva and pupa stages, culminating in the adult bee. This metamorphosis allows for the development of the various castes within a hive, including the queen, workers, and drones, each with specific roles that contribute to the colony's survival and honey production. Worker bees, which are sterile females, are primarily responsible for foraging nectar and pollen, producing honey, and maintaining the hive.
