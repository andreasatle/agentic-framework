The biology of bees encompasses the physical characteristics, behaviors, and life cycle stages that are essential to their role in honey production. Bees are flying insects known for their distinctive body structure, which includes three main parts: the head, thorax, and abdomen. Their bodies are covered with fine hairs that aid in the collection of pollen. Bees possess specialized mouthparts adapted for both biting and sucking, enabling them to gather nectar from flowers.
