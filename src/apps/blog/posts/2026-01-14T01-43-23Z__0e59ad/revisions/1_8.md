Once the forager bees return to the hive, they transfer the nectar to house bees through a process called trophallaxis. During this transfer, enzymes present in the bees' saliva begin the crucial enzymatic transformation of nectar. These enzymes break down complex sugars in the nectar into simpler sugars, which are less prone to crystallization and more suitable for long-term storage.
