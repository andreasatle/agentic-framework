The ecological significance of bees is evident in their contribution to the fertilization of flowering plants, which leads to the production of fruits and seeds. This process ensures the continuation of plant populations and the availability of food resources for a wide range of organisms, including humans. Moreover, the pollination services provided by bees enhance agricultural productivity, making them indispensable to both natural and managed ecosystems.
