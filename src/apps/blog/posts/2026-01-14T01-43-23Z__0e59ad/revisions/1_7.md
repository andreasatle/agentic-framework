The honey production process is a complex biological sequence through which bees transform collected nectar into honey. This process begins with forager bees, which, as part of their natural behavior, collect nectar from flowering plants. The nectar, a sugary liquid, is gathered using the bees' proboscis and stored temporarily in their specialized honey stomachs.
