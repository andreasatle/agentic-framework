The production of honey is a complex biological process carried out by bees, involving the collection of nectar and its subsequent transformation through enzymatic activity. Initially, forager bees, as previously defined, collect nectar from flowering plants using their proboscis. This nectar, a sugary liquid, is stored temporarily in the bee's crop, also known as the honey stomach.
