Once the forager bee returns to the hive, the nectar is transferred to house bees through a process called trophallaxis. These house bees then begin the enzymatic transformation of nectar by adding enzymes such as invertase. This enzyme breaks down the sucrose in nectar into simpler sugars, glucose and fructose, which are less prone to crystallization and easier to digest.
