Anatomically, bees possess specialized structures that facilitate their role in honey production and pollination. Their bodies are divided into three main parts: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The head houses sensory organs such as compound eyes and antennae, which are essential for navigation and communication. The thorax supports three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings, enabling flight and foraging activities. Notably, worker bees have pollen baskets on their hind legs to collect and transport pollen. The abdomen contains the digestive and reproductive organs, as well as the wax-producing glands used to build honeycombs.
