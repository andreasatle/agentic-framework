Bees play a crucial role in maintaining the health and stability of ecosystems through their pollination activities. By transferring pollen from one flower to another, they facilitate the reproduction of many plant species, which in turn supports biodiversity and the functioning of natural habitats. This ecological service is vital for the survival of numerous wild plants and the animals that depend on them.
