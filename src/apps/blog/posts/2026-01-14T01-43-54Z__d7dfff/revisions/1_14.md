In agriculture, bees contribute significantly to crop production. Many fruits, vegetables, and nuts rely on bee pollination to achieve higher yields and better quality. The presence of healthy bee populations can enhance food security and agricultural sustainability by improving the efficiency of pollination, reducing the need for artificial inputs, and supporting the growth of diverse crops.
