Behaviorally, bees exhibit complex social interactions and division of labor that optimize honey production. Worker bees perform various tasks throughout their lifespan, including nursing larvae, cleaning the hive, foraging for nectar and pollen, and producing honey. Communication within the colony is achieved through the waggle dance, which conveys information about the location of food sources. The collective efforts of the colony ensure efficient nectar collection, conversion into honey, and storage within the hive.
