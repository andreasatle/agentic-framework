Bees are a diverse group of flying insects known for their critical role in pollination and honey production. The term "bees" encompasses thousands of species, but the most significant for honey production is the Western honeybee (Apis mellifera). These social insects live in well-organized colonies consisting of a single queen, numerous female worker bees, and male drones.
