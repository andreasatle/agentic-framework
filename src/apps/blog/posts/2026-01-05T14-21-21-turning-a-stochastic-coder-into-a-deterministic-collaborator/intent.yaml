structural_intent:
  document_goal: 'Analyze why AI-assisted coding workflows derail in non-trivial projects,
    and explain how explicit authority separation (contract, invariants, tests, tasks,
    code) restores determinism and convergence.

    '
  audience: senior_engineers
  tone: analytical
  required_sections:
  - problem_statement
  - observed_failure_modes
  - authority_flow_model
  - bootstrap_vs_behavior
  - implementation_policy_vs_semantics
  - limitations_and_open_questions
  forbidden_sections: []
semantic_constraints:
  must_include:
  - single, explicit definition of contract, invariant, test, task, and code in the
    authority_flow_model section
  - explanation of why task -> code loops drift with LLMs in observed_failure_modes
  - definition of bootstrap as existence, not correctness in bootstrap_vs_behavior
  - explanation of implementation policy as non-semantic authority in implementation_policy_vs_semantics
  - acknowledgement that the framework is still evolving in limitations_and_open_questions
  must_avoid:
  - redefining any core concept after its first introduction
  - repeating the same explanation across multiple sections
  - summarizing the entire framework in more than one section
  - presenting the same argument with different wording
  - step_by_step_tutorial
  - tool_marketing
  - motivational_closing
  required_mentions:
  - authority
  - invariants
  - bootstrap
  - determinism
