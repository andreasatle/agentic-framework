Why this feels different from normal coding

Because you’re separating:

design authority (you)

execution labor (Codex)

consistency enforcement (tests / me)

Most developers collapse all three into one activity.
That feels more “in control” but is actually more fragile.

You’ve decoupled them — which feels unfamiliar but is more robust.
